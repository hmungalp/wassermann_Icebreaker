Once upon a time, I used to drive my BMW from Munich to Raesfeld with my girlfriend every weekend. 
We liked to listen to old German musik while on our 7 hour journey. 
My girlfriend had a Hund name Rocky who loved klimaanlage on hot summer days. 
Now it's all gone, I am no longer able to drive that long in a day. 
I have married my girlfriend in a biergarten in Berlin.
I wore lederhose and my girlfriend wore a dirndel, confusing the wedding guests since neither of us were German.
Once we married, I bought my girlfriend a Porsche, and she bought me an Audi.
But I prefer to drive her Porsche and she loves my Audi better.
We often drive down the Hauptstrasse together on summer evenings.
We like to drive to the baeckerei to pick up brot to eat with our bratwurst.
Our Hund Rocky loves to eat bratwurst while we are driving.
We like to listen to Rammstein while we drive around in my Audi.
Today we're going to the Flughafen with our bratwurst eating hund.
And we are also going to the baeckerei to get some gebaeck.
